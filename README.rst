|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |PyPI Status|

Implementation of a Reliable UDP Protocol Layer over Twisted.

This implementation makes no explicit effort to adhere to any published
standard about RUDP (RFCs, etc).

Installation
------------
::

    pip install txrudp

In order to use encrypted connections, you need to install ``txrudp`` with
the ``crypto`` extension:

::

    pip install txrudp[crypto]

This extension denends on the ``PyNaCl`` package, and attempts to install it
as part of the setup. Installation is known to fail on Windows. See
`this <http://geroyblog.blogspot.gr/2015/03/compiling-and-using-pynacl-on-windows-7.html>`__
about manually installing ``PyNaCl`` on Windows.

Python 3 support
----------------
Support for Python 3 will be made available as soon as the ``protobuf`` package officially
supports Python 3.
